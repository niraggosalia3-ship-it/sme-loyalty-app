# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Generation

1. Open `create-icons.html` in a browser
2. Icons will be automatically downloaded
3. Move them to this directory

## Manual Creation

You can create icons using any image editor:
- Minimum size: 192x192 and 512x512
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Recommended: Use your company logo or a wallet icon

## Placeholder Icons

If icons are missing, the PWA will still work but may show a default browser icon.
