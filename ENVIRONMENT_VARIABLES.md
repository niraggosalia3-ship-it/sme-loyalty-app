# Environment Variables - Exact Values for Vercel

## All 3 Environment Variables You Need

### 1. DATABASE_URL

**Key:** `DATABASE_URL`

**Value (Connection Pooler - Recommended):**
```
postgresql://postgres.dkwewdazxjbmjihriplv:gbZXQ%2F%2AE9y%21%21Ks%23@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

**OR (Direct Connection - if pooler doesn't work):**
```
postgresql://postgres:gbZXQ%2F%2AE9y%21%21Ks%23@db.dkwewdazxjbmjihriplv.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Important Notes:**
- Password is URL-encoded: `gbZXQ%2F%2AE9y%21%21Ks%23`
- No spaces before or after
- No quotes around the value
- **Use Connection Pooler (6543) first** - it's more reliable for Vercel

**How to get the correct one:**
1. Go to Supabase → Settings → Database
2. Under "Connection pooling", copy the connection string
3. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with URL-encoded: `gbZXQ%2F%2AE9y%21%21Ks%23`
4. Use that value

### 2. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL

**Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

**Value:**
```
https://sme-loyalty-app1.vercel.app
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use the **production URL** (main domain), not preview URLs
- Your production URL is: `sme-loyalty-app1.vercel.app`
- No trailing slash
- Must be `https://` (not `http://`)
- The preview URLs (like `sme-loyalty-app1-git-main-...`) are auto-generated - don't use those

---

### 3. BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN

**Key:** `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

**Value:**
```
[Auto-generated by Vercel - copy from Storage tab]
```

**How to get it:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project
2. Click **"Storage"** tab
3. Click on your Blob storage
4. Find **"Environment Variables"** or **"Connection String"** section
5. Copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` value
6. It will look like: `vercel_blob_rw_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Important Notes:**
- This is auto-generated when you create Blob storage
- If you don't have Blob storage yet, create it first
- The token is long and starts with `vercel_blob_rw_`
